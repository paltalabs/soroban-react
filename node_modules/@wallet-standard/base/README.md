# `@wallet-standard/base`

This package defines the foundational TypeScript types of the Wallet Standard, and so provides a practical specification
of the Wallet Standard until a formal specification may be completed.

A wallet that implements the Wallet Standard is referred to as a **Standard Wallet**, or simply a **Wallet**. An account
within a Wallet is referred to as a **WalletAccount** or simply an **Account**.

This package contains only TypeScript types. There is no executable JavaScript code.
