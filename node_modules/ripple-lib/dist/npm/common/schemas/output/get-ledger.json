If this flag is enabled, it means that validators disagreed on the correct close time for the ledger, but built otherwise the same ledger, so they declared consensus while \"agreeing to disagree\" on the close time. In this case, the consensus ledger contains a `closeTime` value that is 1 second after that of the previous ledger. (In this case, there is no official close time, but the actual real-world close time is probably 3-6 seconds later than the specified `closeTime`.)"
